# Cognee Memory Search

Search both session memory and the permanent knowledge graph, optionally filtered by data category.

## Automatic session search

Session memory is searched **automatically on every user prompt** via the `UserPromptSubmit` hook. You do not need to run this skill to access current-session context.

## Data categories

Knowledge is organized into three categories via `node_set`:

| Category | Node set | Contains |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **user** | `user_context` | User preferences, corrections, personal facts |
| **project** | `project_docs` | Repository docs, code context, architecture decisions |
| **agent** | `agent_actions` | Tool call logs, reasoning traces, generated artifacts |

## Instructions

Search goes through the **running Cognee server** (`POST /api/v1/recall`) — the source of truth. Use the wrapper below: it queries the server first, searches **all your authorized datasets** (so a hit isn't missed because it lives in another dataset), and falls back to `cognee-cli` only if the server is unreachable.

### Search (server-first)

```bash
# session cache + permanent graph (default)
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cognee-search.sh "$ARGUMENTS"

# permanent graph only
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cognee-search.sh "$ARGUMENTS" 10 --graph

# current session only
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cognee-search.sh "$ARGUMENTS" 10 --session
```

### Filter by category (optional)

Categories (`user_context` / `project_docs` / `agent_actions`) filter by `node_set`, currently exposed via the CLI (same server backend):

```bash
cognee-cli recall "$ARGUMENTS" --node-set project_docs -k 5 -f json
```

### Ground-truth a suspicious result (debugging)

The server is authoritative. If a search returns empty but you expect content, confirm directly — **do not** conclude "not found" from empty CLI output:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${COGNEE_BASE_URL:-http://localhost:8011}/api/v1/recall" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ${COGNEE_API_KEY:+-H "X-Api-Key: $COGNEE_API_KEY"} \
  -d "{\"query\": \"$ARGUMENTS\", \"top_k\": 5, \"only_context\": true, \"scope\": [\"graph\"]}"
```

### Fallback only — server unreachable

`cognee-cli` is a thin client over the same server and can print **empty stdout even when content exists**. Use it only when the server is down, and treat empty output as *inconclusive*, never as "no results":

```bash
cognee-cli recall "$ARGUMENTS" -k 5 -f json
```

## Understanding results

Results include a `_source` field:
- `"session"` — from the session cache (current conversation)
- `"graph"` — from the permanent knowledge graph

Session entries tagged with `[category:agent]` are automatic tool call logs.

## Decision table

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Need current session context | Already automatic, no action needed |
| User explicitly says "search cognee" | `cognee-search.sh "<query>"` (server-first) |
| "what does the codebase do" / "what did we do last time" | `cognee-search.sh "<query>" 10 --graph` |
| Need a specific category | add `--node-set {user_context\|project_docs\|agent_actions}` via the CLI form |
| Auto context insufficient | `cognee-search.sh "<query>" 10 --session` |
| **Result empty but you expect content** | **Ground-truth via the `curl` above before concluding "not found"** |
