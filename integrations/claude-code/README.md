# Cognee Memory Plugin for Claude Code

Adds persistent memory to Claude Code through Cognee.

The integration:
- captures prompts, tool traces, and assistant responses into session memory
- injects relevant context on prompt submit
- syncs session memory into graph memory on session end/final exit

## Install

Install from the Claude Code marketplace. You can do this interactively by typing slash commands directly in the Claude Code chat:

```
/plugin marketplace add topoteretes/cognee-integrations
/plugin install cognee-memory@cognee
```

Then set environment variables for your runtime mode.

**Cognee Cloud or a remote server** — set both:

```bash
export COGNEE_BASE_URL="https://your-instance.cognee.ai"
export COGNEE_API_KEY="ck_..."
```

**Local mode** (default when `COGNEE_BASE_URL` is not set) — the plugin bootstraps a local Cognee API at `http://localhost:8011`. Only `LLM_API_KEY` is required; `COGNEE_API_KEY` is auto-minted if absent:

```bash
export LLM_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

You can also set config in `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/config.json`:

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://your-instance.cognee.ai",
  "dataset": "agent_sessions"
}
```

On startup you should see a "Cognee Memory Connected" system message.

## Auth

The integration uses a **single auth principal** — one API key, one user.

Key resolution order:
1. `COGNEE_API_KEY` env var
2. `~/.cognee-plugin/api_key.json` (cached from a previous mint)
3. Auto-mint from the default local user (local mode only), then cache to `api_key.json`

## Mode selection rules

At startup (`SessionStart`):
- `COGNEE_BASE_URL` set → `managed_endpoint`, either local, or on Cognee Cloud (API key needed in cloud case)
- otherwise → `integration_local` (local API bootstrap)

At hook runtime:
- hooks resolve mode through runtime endpoint auth (env + `api_key.json`), not only config intent
- `http` mode skips local SDK initialization

The hooks emit `mode_decision` logs with `mode`, `service_url`, `url_source`, `key_source`, `api_key_present`.

## Sessions

Each terminal launch maintains a small map file:

```
~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/sessions/<host_session_id>.json
  → { "conn_uuid": "...", "session_id": "...", "host_key": "..." }
```

- **`session_id`** — which Cognee session this terminal writes to and recalls from. Fixed at launch.
- **`conn_uuid`** — per-launch liveness handle used for agent registration and server shutdown counting.

By default a new `session_id` is generated each launch. Set `COGNEE_SESSION_ID` to resume a specific session:

```bash
export COGNEE_SESSION_ID="my-project"
```

Two terminals can deliberately share a session by setting the same `COGNEE_SESSION_ID`.

## Dataset

All writes and recall are scoped to a single dataset. By default both the Claude Code and Codex plugins use `agent_sessions`, so memory is shared across both integrations automatically.

Set a custom dataset at launch:

```bash
export COGNEE_PLUGIN_DATASET="my-project-memory"
```

Or persist it per-project in `.cognee/session-config.json` in your workspace root:

```json
{ "dataset": "my-project-memory" }
```

For safety, the project picker file only honors non-sensitive selection keys
(`dataset`, `session_strategy`, `session_prefix`, `agent_name`, `top_k`) — any
other key (e.g. `base_url`, `api_key`) is ignored, so opening a repo that ships a
`.cognee/session-config.json` can never redirect your backend or inject
credentials. Commit it for a shared project default, or `.gitignore` it for a
personal local override.

Or persist it globally in `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/config.json`:

```json
{ "dataset": "my-project-memory" }
```

The dataset is fixed for the lifetime of a launch. Recall searches only the active dataset. If you want to
change the active dataset, you have to exit Claude, change the dataset via env, and then start Claude again.
Data added outside of Claude to the dataset (via SDK or the server for example) is visible in Claude via the Cognee plugin.

## Hooks

| Hook | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | mode select, identity setup, dataset readiness, watcher bootstrap |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | dataset-scoped context lookup + async prompt staging |
| `PostToolUse` | async trace write |
| `Stop` | assistant answer write + optional transcript clear hook |
| `PreCompact` | memory anchor build before compaction |
| `SessionEnd` | trigger detached final sync worker |

Claude-specific contracts are preserved:
- `hookSpecificOutput` payload format
- async hook behavior for write hooks

## Memory preference

With the plugin active, Cognee is the **preferred** memory system: relevant memory is
auto-recalled into context on every `UserPromptSubmit` and writes are captured
automatically, so Claude consults Cognee first when answering. To reinforce this, the
`SessionStart` hook injects an `additionalContext` instruction telling Claude to treat
Cognee as authoritative and prefer the Cognee tools/skills over Claude Code's built-in
file memory (`MEMORY.md`).

Note: a plugin **cannot reliably disable** Claude Code's native auto memory
(`MEMORY.md` is injected as context, not a tool call that hooks can intercept). This
feature steers the model toward Cognee rather than hard-disabling native memory. To
turn the steer off, set `COGNEE_PREFER_MEMORY=false`. To additionally suppress native
auto memory yourself, disable it in Claude Code (e.g. `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1`
in the launching shell, if your Claude Code version supports it).

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `COGNEE_PREFER_MEMORY` | `true` | Inject SessionStart steer asserting Cognee as the preferred memory |

## Session sync and watchers

An idle watcher runs in the background for the lifetime of each launch. It polls activity every `COGNEE_IDLE_POLL` seconds and persists the session cache when the session has been quiet for `COGNEE_IDLE_THRESHOLD` seconds, then waits at least `COGNEE_IMPROVE_COOLDOWN` seconds before the next run.

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `COGNEE_IDLE_POLL` | `10` | Poll interval in seconds |
| `COGNEE_IDLE_THRESHOLD` | `60` | Seconds of inactivity before idle sync fires |
| `COGNEE_IMPROVE_COOLDOWN` | `120` | Minimum seconds between idle sync runs |

Final sync on session end is triggered by the `SessionEnd` detached worker, with an exit watcher as fallback if the process exits without firing `SessionEnd`.

## Skills

- `/cognee-memory:cognee-remember`
- `/cognee-memory:cognee-search`
- `/cognee-memory:cognee-sync`

## Remember (write) behavior

`cognee-remember` and the auto-capture hooks POST to the server's `/api/v1/remember`
and ask it to build the graph **in the background** (`run_in_background=true`), so the
write returns as soon as it's enqueued instead of blocking the turn on a synchronous
cognify. A synchronous build can take tens of seconds, exceed the client timeout, and be
misread as "server unreachable" — which then triggers a `cognee-cli` fallback that can
double-write. The graph populates shortly after the call, so a recall in the same breath
may not see the new entry yet.

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `COGNEE_REMEMBER_BACKGROUND` | `true` | Build the graph in the background; set `false` for a synchronous, immediately-queryable write |

A write that *times out* is reported as "submitted; timed out waiting for confirmation"
and does **not** fall back to `cognee-cli` (the write likely landed — a fallback would
risk a duplicate). Only a genuine connection failure falls back.

## Status line

The status line displays `cognee: <dataset> · <mode>`, for example:

```
cognee: agent_sessions · local
cognee: my-project · cloud
```

`<dataset>` is the active Cognee dataset. `<mode>` is `local` when no `COGNEE_BASE_URL` is set or when it points to localhost, and `cloud` when it points to a remote host.

It is configured automatically on first launch — no manual steps needed. SessionStart writes the correct path into `~/.claude/settings.json` and Claude Code hot-reloads it, so the status line appears from your first interaction onward.

The status line reads only local state — no network calls on every refresh:
1. `COGNEE_PLUGIN_DATASET` / `COGNEE_BASE_URL` env vars (if set in the terminal that launched Claude Code)
2. `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/config.json` → `dataset` and `base_url` keys
3. Default: `cognee: agent_sessions · local`

## Auto-clear demo hook

For demo flows where each response should clear local transcript context:

```bash
export COGNEE_CLAUDE_CLEAR_AFTER_MESSAGE=true
```

This clears the transcript file on `Stop` after memory capture.

## Logs and state

Claude Code-specific plugin state and logs are written under:

```bash
~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/
```

Useful logs:

```bash
tail -f ~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/hook.log
tail -f ~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/subprocess.log
tail -f ~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/watcher.log
tail -f ~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/exit-watcher.log
tail -f ~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/recall-audit.log
```

Shared state (used by both Claude Code and Codex plugins):

```bash
~/.cognee-plugin/api_key.json     # cached API key
~/.cognee-plugin/venv/            # shared Cognee virtualenv
```

## Update or remove

Reinstall the plugin to pick up marketplace updates (run inside Claude Code chat):

```
/plugin uninstall cognee-memory@cognee
/plugin install cognee-memory@cognee
```

To also refresh the marketplace source:

```
/plugin uninstall cognee-memory@cognee
/plugin marketplace remove topoteretes/cognee-integrations
/plugin marketplace add topoteretes/cognee-integrations
/plugin install cognee-memory@cognee
```

There is no automatic update mechanism — reinstall is the only way to pull in new plugin versions.

## Troubleshooting

**Recall returns empty but data was ingested**
- Recall is scoped to the active dataset (`COGNEE_PLUGIN_DATASET` / `config.json` / `agent_sessions`).
- Data written via the Python SDK or `client.py` goes to `default_dataset` by default, if dataset not otherwise specified.
- To verify, call the recall API directly without a dataset filter: `curl -X POST "$COGNEE_BASE_URL/api/v1/recall" -d '{"query":"..."}'`

**Session not resolving / wrong session shown**
- Check `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/sessions/<host_session_id>.json` — this is the map file for your terminal.
- If it's missing, SessionStart may not have completed; check `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/hook.log`.

**Unauthorized / key errors**
- Check `~/.cognee-plugin/api_key.json`. Delete it to force a re-mint.
- Relevant logs: `api_key_cached`, `api_key_minted`, `agent_register_result`.

**Missing session key at startup**
- If the payload session key is missing, SessionStart refuses registration.
- Relevant logs: `session_key_resolved`, `missing_payload_session_id`.

**Final sync diagnostics**
- Check `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/hook.log` and `~/.cognee-plugin/claude-code/exit-watcher.log`.
- Relevant logs: `sync_deferred_to_shutdown_worker`, `final_sync_once_*`, `agent_unregister_result`.
